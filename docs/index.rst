Welcome to Misbehave's documentation!
=====================================

Misbehave is a Python behavior tree implementation. A behavior tree is a design
pattern that breaks complex state-based actions into their component parts to
improve readability and re-usability for autonomous agents. A good starting
place to understand them is here_.

Misbehave focused on python language features not available in other languages,
so some of the common features of AI design are missing by default. The rest of
this document is lightly hedged in its language as behavior trees can be useful
for video games or robots.
